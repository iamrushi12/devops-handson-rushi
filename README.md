What I learn from this HandsOn session :
I learned how to run a React app locally using Node.js and npm, provision an EC2 instance with Terraform, securely connect via SSH, and push my project to GitHub using PAT-based authentication. I also resolved common .pem permission and .terraform Git issues during the process.
